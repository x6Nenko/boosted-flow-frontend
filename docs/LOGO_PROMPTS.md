# Logo Prompts for Boosted Flow

These prompts are designed for AI image generators (Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion) to create a "dead simple" but catchy logo for **Boosted Flow**.

## Principles
- **Vibe:** Minimalist, Modern, Tech-focused, "Dead Simple".
- **Colors:** Monochrome (Black/Dark Grey/White) with accents of "Brand Cream" (soft warm white/beige) and subtle "Glass" effects.
- **Keywords:** Flow, Time, Focus, Boost, Momentum, Minimal.

## Minimalist & Geometric

1. **The Abstract B:**
   > A minimalist vector logo of the letter 'B' formed by flowing lines. The lines should suggest motion and speed, like wind tunnels. Flat design, matte black on a white background. Dead simple, recognizable at small sizes.

2. **The Split Circle:**
   > A simple geometric logo consisting of a circle split in half by a lightning bolt shape used as negative space. Minimalist style, thick line weight. Black and cream color palette. vector graphics.

3. **Two shapes:**
   > A minimal logo focusing on the interaction of two shapes: a steady square representing "time" and a fluid wave shape representing "flow" cutting through it. Bauhaus style, clean geometry. Dark grey and soft beige.

4. **Monogram BF:**
   > An interlocking monogram of the letters 'B' and 'F'. The lines are continuous and form a circuit-like path. Tech-minimalist aesthetic. Solid thick strokes, no gradients.

5. **The Pulse:**
   > A simple circle with a "heartbeat" or pulse line running through the center. Represents focus and vitality. Very clean, clinical design. White line on a black background.

## Flow & Motion

6. **The Stream:**
   > A logo depicting a stylistic, abstract stream or river flowing upwards. Use 3 parallel curved lines that taper at the top. Represents "boosted flow". Gradient fill from dark grey to cream. Sleek and modern.

7. **The Forward Arrow:**
   > A stylized 'Play' button triangle that morphs into a wave on the right side. Symbolizing starting work and getting into flow. Soft rounded corners. Glassmorphism style with slight transparency and blur.

8. **Orbiting Focus:**
   > A central solid dot representing the user, surrounded by two orbiting rings that are slightly offset/tilted. Represents "zoning in". Thin, elegant lines. Technical drawing style.

9. **Speed Lines:**
   > Sample text "Boosted Flow" in a heavy sans-serif font, where the letters seem to be melting or trailing off to the right due to high speed. Cyberpunk minimal aesthetic. Monochromatic.

10. **The Rising Tide:**
    > An abstract bar chart where the bars turn into a smooth rising wave curve. Symbolizing productivity improvement. Flat vector art, two colors: charcoal and cream.

## Time & Efficiency

11. **The Hourglass Shift:**
    > A modern, simplified hourglass icon. Instead of sand, the bottom bulb is filled with a lightning bolt shape. Representing "charged time". Line art style, consistent stroke width.

12. **The Fast Clock:**
    > A clock face without numbers, only hands. The hands are blurred slightly to indicate rapid movement/spinning. "Time flies when you have flow". Minimalist, eerie, modern.

13. **Digital Colon:**
    > A logo focused solely on the blinking colon of a digital clock ( : ), but the dots are stylized as small sparks or diamonds. Extremely minimal. "It's about time".

14. **The Infinity Loop:**
    > A sideways figure-8 (infinity symbol) that looks like a racetrack. One section is highlighted in "Brand Cream" to suggest a "boost" zone. Flat design.

15. **Slice of Time:**
    > A circle representing a pie chart, with one slice pulled out and glowing. The slice looks like a play button. Isometric view, 3D clay render style, soft lighting.

## Tech & Glassmorphism

16. **The Glass Stack:**
    > Three translucent, frosted glass layers stacked slightly offset from each other. Looking down from the top. They form an abstract arrow shape. Soft shadows, diffuse light. High-end tech aesthetic.

17. **The Glowing Chip:**
    > A microchip-inspired square logo with a glowing "flow" line running through the circuitry. Neon cream color on a dark slate background. detailed but symmetrical.

18. **Fluid Container:**
    > A clear glass vessel in the shape of a 'U', with a cream-colored liquid splashing inside. Hyper-realistic 3D render, white background, studio lighting. Energetic and fresh.

19. **Isometric Block:**
    > An isometric cube where one corner is cut off by a smooth, curved surface. Matte finish. The cut surface is a glowing cream color. Architectural and structured.

20. **Typographic Hero:**
    > The word "BOOST" in a bold, extended grotesque font. The double 'O's are interlinked like chain links. The word "flow" is in a smaller handwritten script underneath. High contrast black and white.
